			<br>
			Welcome to my humble online abode. Here you can find some information about my education and professional experience. I may also add hints that allude to my personal life (for those curious). 
			<br>
			<br>
			My name is Scott Havard. I graduated from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo with a BS in Biomedical Engineering. I chose to focus my efforts on the electrical side of the discipline, but I love it all. It isn't easy to find a major where you can grow Lactobacillus and program a MCU in the same day. Moreover, I am just as likely to be found tinkering with digital electronics as I am trying to ferment produce. Most importantly, the exposure to a wide range of disciplines showed me the importance of data driven decisions, and the profound value of both qualitative and quantitative information.
			<br> 
			<br>
			With a little luck and perserverence I found myself working at Salutron. Salutron is currently developing biometric technologies that will change peoples understanding of themselves. Their ultimate mission is to promote societal health. I held the formal title of "test engineer" and had the pleasure of validating and playing with innovative technology. This ranges from testing device performance on humans, to verifying that a conductive pathway has extremely low resistance. I got to essentially build and create with the best. A little solder here, a little code there, and I topped it off with industrial epoxy to stain the work pants.
			<br>
			<br>
			In my hunger for experience, I decided to switch things up and I found myself working for iFixit. iFixit is a company on a mission, ultimately working to empower consumers through repair. I had the honor of creating free repair documentation for the masses. This necessitates a diverse set of skills, such as writing SQL queries that determine popularity of certain guides and using Photoshop to edit our grade-A teardown photos. I also have had the honor to speak to the masses through our YouTube channel, as well as at large industry trade shows.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the summer I am an Ocean Lifeguard at Avila Beach. This provides much needed sunlight and saltwater to keep me sane. Couple this with the best coworkers one could ask for and being able to safely promote the ocean, and you find the perfect way to spend the summer. Being able to split time between engineering and lifeguarding affords personal development in a unique and unreplicable way. And getting paid to exercise in the ocean isn't that bad of a deal either.
			<br>
			<br>
			Whatever the reason is that brought you to this page, I encourage you to reach out to me. I always embrace new people and perspectives.
